A)sysmon

-persistent after isntallation
-provides deatiled info regarding process, network, and changes to file creation
-used in conjuction with a siem

B)sysmon cofig

-sysmon needs a config file to tell the binary how to analyze events
-can be created or downlaoded 
-when creating it excludes events that are usual/normal

event 1: process creation (as thename implies)
event 3 :network connection (remote activities)
event 7: image loaded (looks for dll loaded by the process) it uses high sytem load
event 8: create remote thread (monitors process injecting codes into other process)
event 11: file created ( files created or overwritten at endpoint)
event 12-14: registry event (changes/mod at the registry)
event 15: file craete stream hash (files created in an alternate data stream)
event 22: DNS event (DNS queries and events)

C)isntalling sysmon

-go to powershell
Download-SysInternalsTools C:\Sysinternals

D)starting sysmon
-cmd as admin
Sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xml

F) challenge Filter
-to know how many event ID 3 there is, manually go to the event viewer and filter by event ID
- to know what time the first network event is use
Get-WinEvent -Path .\file.extx -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3' -Oldest -Max Events 1 | fl -property *

G) challenge metasploit
-by default metasploit uses port 4444
Get-WinEvent -Path <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3 and */EventData/Data[@Name="DestinationPort"] and */EventData/Data=4444'
-add | fl -property * to view details

H) chllenge mimikatz
-dumps LSASS 
Get-WinEvent -Path <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=10 and */EventData/Data[@Name="TargetImage"] and */EventData/Data="C:\Windows\system32'lsass.exe"'

I)challenge malware
Get-WinEvent -Path <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3 and */EventData/Data[@Name="DestinationPort"] and */EventData/Data=<Port>'

J)challenge alternate data stream
Get-WinEvent -Path <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=15'

K) challenge thread creation
Get-WinEvent -Path <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=8'

**check the event viewer for available eventID
