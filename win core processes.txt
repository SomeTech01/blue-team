windows process

system - PID of 4

usual info
	Image Path:  N/A
	Parent Process:  None
	Number of Instances:  One
	User Account:  Local System
	Start Time:  At boot time

What is unusual behavior for this process?
		A parent process (aside from System Idle Process (0))
		Multiple instances of System. (Should only be 1 instance)

System > smss.exe
	-windows session manager ( creates new sessions)
	-first user-mode started by kernel
	-starts kernel and user mode of Windows subsystem (win32.sys{kernel} , winsrv.dll {user}, & csrss.exe {user})
	-in session 0 it starts csrss.exe (Windows subsystem) and wininit.exe ( isolated windows session for the OS)
	-in session 1 csrss.exe and winlogon.exe 

usual info
	Image Path:  %SystemRoot%\System32\smss.exe
	Parent Process:  System
	Number of Instances:  One master instance and child instance per session. The 	child instance exits after creating the session.
	User Account:  Local System
	Start Time:  Within seconds of boot time for the master instance

What is unusual?
	A different parent process other than System(4)
	Image path is different from C:\Windows\System32
	More than 1 running process. (children self-terminate and exit after each new session)
	User is not SYSTEM
	Unexpected registry entries for Subsystem


csrss.exe -Client Server Runtime Process
	-user-mode side of the windows subsystem
	-if terminated will result in failure
	-responsible for win32 console & proces creation/deletion
	- For each instance csrsrv.dll, basesrv.dll, and winsrv.dll are loaded (along with others)
	-responsible to make API avaible to other process, mapp drive letters & handle windows shutdwon process

Recall that csrss.exe and winlogon.exe are called from smss.exe at startup for Session 1

usual info
	Image Path:  %SystemRoot%\System32\csrss.exe
	Parent Process:  Created by an instance of smss.exe
	Number of Instances:  Two or more
	User Account:  Local System
	Start Time:  Within seconds of boot time for the first 2 instances (for Session 0 and 1).  Start times for additional instances occur as new sessions are created, although often only Sessions 0 and 1 are created.

What is unusual?
	An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
	Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
	Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process masquerading as csrss.exe in plain sight
	User is not SYSTEM

wininit.exe

-The Windows Initialization Process, wininit.exe, is responsible for launching services.exe (Service Control Manager), lsass.exe (Local Security Authority), and lsaiso.exe within Session 0.
-This is another critical Windows process that runs in the background, along with its child processes. 
-lsaiso.exe is a process associated with Credential Guard and Key Guard. You will only see this process if Credential Guard is enabled

	Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
	Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
	Multiple running instances
	Not running as SYSTEM

wininit.exe > services.exe
	-Service Control Manager (SCM), which is services.exe. Its primary responsibility is to handle system services: loading services, interacting with services, starting/ending services, etc. It maintains a database that can be queried using a Windows built-in utility, 'sc.exe.'
	-This process also loads device drivers marked as auto-start into memory

	Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
	Multiple running instances
	Not running as SYSTEM

wininit.exe > services.exe > svchost.exe

-is responsible for hosting and managing Windows services.
-The services running in this process are implemented as DLLs. The DLL to implement is stored in the registry for the service under the Parameters subkey in ServiceDLL. The full path is HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SERVICE NAME\Parameters.

usual info
	Image Path: %SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe
	Parent Process: services.exe
	Number of Instances: Many
	User Account: Varies (SYSTEM, Network Service, Local Service) depending on the svchost.exe instance. In Windows 10 some instances can run as the logged-in user.
	Start Time: Typically within seconds of boot time. Other instances can be started after boot

What is unusual?
	A parent process other than services.exe
	Image file path other than C:\Windows\System32
	Subtle misspellings to hide rogue process in plain sight
	The absence of the -k parameter

lsass.exe
-Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
- responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system
-It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates access tokens. It also writes to the Windows Security Log
-It creates security tokens for SAM (Security Account Manager), AD (Active Directory), and NETLOGON

winlogon.exe
- Windows Logon, winlogon.exe, is responsible for handling the Secure Attention Sequence (SAS)
-This is the ALT+CTRL+DELETE key combination users press to enter their username & password. 
-loads the profiles (done by loading the user's NTUSER.DAT into HKCU and via userinit.exe loads the user's shell)
-also runs screensacer

usual info
	Image Path:  %SystemRoot%\System32\winlogon.exe
	Parent Process:  Created by an instance of smss.exe that exits, so analysis tools usually do not provide the parent process name.
	Number of Instances:  One or more
	User Account:  Local System
	Start Time:  Within seconds of boot time for the first instance (for Session 1).  Additional instances occur as new sessions are created, typically through Remote Desktop or Fast User Switching logons

What is unusual?
	An actual parent process. (smss.exe calls this process and self-terminates)
