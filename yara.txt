yara 
loki
1) go to file location
2) run python /path/to/loki.py -p .
3) read the logs
4) nano the file if you want further info ( file 2 is undetected by loki)
	strings <file name> | wc -l ( to see how many lines in the code)
yaraGen
To use yarGen to generate a Yara rule for file 2, you can run the following command:

python3 yarGen.py -m /home/cmnatic/suspicious-files/file2 --excludegood -o /home/cmnatic/suspicious-files/file2.yar 

A brief explanation of the parameters above:

-m is the path to the files you want to generate rules for
--excludegood force to exclude all goodware strings (these are strings found in legitimate software and can increase false positives)
-o location & name you want to output the Yara rule
